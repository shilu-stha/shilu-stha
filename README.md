## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Software Architect turned Machine Learning Researcher**, currently studying  
**MSc Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bath**.  

With **12+ years** of leadership in mobile, web, backend and distributed systems  
(CTO, Senior Software Engineer, Architect), I am now transitioning into **ML Systems**,  
focusing on:

- Efficient training & optimisation  
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning  
- Deep learning theory (CNNs, Transformers, Bayesian modelling)  
- ML deployment, scalability & system design  
- LLM integration & retrieval-augmented pipelines (RAG)  

My background combines **strong engineering depth** with **research-driven curiosity**.
