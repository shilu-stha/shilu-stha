## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Architect and Engineer with 12+ years of hands-on development experience**, currently pursuing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Bath.  

I bring extensive experience across **mobile apps, web platforms, backend engineering, cloud services, AI-integrated systems**, and large production applications. After years of leading projects end-to-end, I am now expanding into advanced ML and AI during my master’s studies — combining my engineering depth with new emerging skills.

I am highly **adaptable, fast-learning, efficient**, and comfortable switching between roles such as developer, architect, team lead, problem-solver, or freelancer. I thrive in environments where quick thinking, clear structure, and practical delivery are valued.

I’m currently using my GitHub to document my learning, personal projects, and upcoming AI coursework — starting with a structured ML blog series.

## 🎓 Current Focus  
**MSc in Artificial Intelligence (University of Bath)**  
Modules include: Machine Learning, Applied AI, Deep Learning, Probability & Statistics, Reinforcement Learning, Data Analysis.

My MSc is helping me strengthen fundamentals such as:
- Optimisation  
- Classical ML (regression, Bayesian methods)  
- Deep learning (CNNs, representation learning)  
- Reinforcement learning (multi-agent basics)  
- Statistical reasoning  

I’m in a transition phase where I am exploring how to combine my **strong engineering background** with **AI skills** to prepare for future roles in intelligent systems, ML-enabled products, automation, and scalable software.
